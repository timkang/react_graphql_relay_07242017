Exercise #7

1. Add an edit row component which allows a car to be edited.

2. Configure the table to allow a row to switch between edit mode and view mode.

3. In view mode, a row should have an edit button, and a delete button. The edit button switches the row to edit mode, the delete button deletes the car.

4. In edit more, a row should have a save button and a cancel button. The save button will save the data to server and switch to view mode. The cancel button cancels the changes, and switches to view mode.

5. Add the code to the GraphQL server to support the car mutations.
